/*
HCF (Highest Common Factor), also known as GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), is the largest number that divides two or more numbers exactly without leaving a remainder.

Example:
Find HCF of 12 and 18
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
ðŸ‘‰ The highest common factor is 6. So, HCF(12,18) = 6 âœ…

HCF is useful in simplifying fractions, number theory, and problem-solving. ðŸš€
